    text: >-
      At Unlock NYC, we know how important it is to have proof when you face
      unfair treatment in your housing search. We're here to help you collect
      evidence in a safe and secure way. With our Rights Recorder app, you can
      record phone calls with brokers and landlords to have a record of what was
      said. For emails, text messages, and other written communication, make
      sure to take clear screenshots that show any denials or ghosting from
      agents. We'll help you keep all your evidence organized and secure, so you
      can report what happened whenever you're ready.

      Don't wait! Use our Rights Recorder app to make a report while the details
      are fresh in your mind. The sooner you report, the more options you may
      have to seek justice. Our app will guide you through answering some
      questions about what happened and allow you to upload any evidence you
      have. Once we receive your report, our Unlock NYC team will review it, and
      may ask you for more details if needed. We'll also conduct research on the
      broker and landlord involved. In just 1-2 business days, we'll send you a
      copy of your report for your records.
