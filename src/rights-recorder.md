    text: >-
      At Unlock NYC, we know how important it is to have proof when you face
      unfair treatment in your housing search. We're here to help you collect
      evidence in a safe and secure way. With our Rights Recorder app, you can
      record phone calls with brokers and landlords to have a record of what was
      said. For emails, text messages, and other written communication, make
      sure to take clear screenshots that show any denials or ghosting from
      agents. We'll help you keep all your evidence organized and secure, so you
      can report what happened whenever you're ready.
