bannerSubtitle: $1.3 million for fair housing enforcement
bannerText: >-
  Our movement fought hard to increase the size of the SOI Unit at the NYC
  Commission on Human Rights – and we won an unprecedented $1.3 million dollars
  in the most recent budget. These resources are now threatened by the Mayor’s
  latest round of budget cuts and PEGs (Program to Eliminate the Gap). Unlock
  NYC continues to work closely with our organizing partners to stress that the
  NYC Commission on Human Rights must be exempt from these PEGs so that they can
  continue to enforce the Human Rights Law.

      Fair housing for all New Yorkers will take a mass, people-powered movement
      to win transformative change. Since 2020, when we joined the
      #HomelessCantStayHome and VALUE in Housing campaigns, we have taken our
      cues from allies in the housing movement. We are also on the steering
      committee of the Human Rights Law Working Group and a member of the Homes
      Can't Wait Coalition and Housing Justice for All.

      We couldn’t do this work without the hundreds of New Yorkers who’ve shared
      their stories and insights with us through interviews, surveys, community
      design sessions, and more. Our research reports always include data
      interpretation and feedback from directly-impacted tenants – get in touch
      if you'd like to get your members involved.
