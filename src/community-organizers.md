bannerText: >-
  Our movement fought hard to increase the size of the SOI Unit at the NYC
  Commission on Human Rights – and we won an unprecedented $1.3 million dollars
  in the most recent budget. These resources are now threatened by the Mayor’s
  latest round of budget cuts and PEGs (Program to Eliminate the Gap). Unlock
  NYC continues to work closely with our organizing partners to stress that the
  NYC Commission on Human Rights must be exempt from these PEGs so that they can
  continue to enforce the Human Rights Law.
