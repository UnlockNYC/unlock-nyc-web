Dear friends and community,
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
It is with heavy hearts and deep sorrow that we share the passing of our dear colleague, friend, and beloved community member, <strong>Manon Vergerio</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Manon co-founded Unlock NYC and served as our Head of Data and Advocacy. Her brilliance, integrity, and profound commitment to justice shaped our organization and touched countless lives. She was a born organizer and an exceptional advocate — and yet Manon was always so much more than her work. It was her humanity and vibrant, generous spirit that truly defined her. Manon was an incredible human being, a source of warmth and joy, and she worked with great intention to make people feel seen, cared for, and deeply supported. She brought laughter, kindness, and love into all our lives, even in the most challenging moments.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Manon leaves behind her daughter, Skye, and her husband, Alex, as well as her family, team, and community who are heartbroken by this sudden loss. Our thoughts are with them as they navigate unimaginable grief.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
As we hold Manon and her loved ones in our hearts, we at Unlock ask for patience and understanding in the days ahead. In time, we will share ways to honor Manon’s memory and legacy. For now, we are sitting with our grief, remembering her light, and holding each other close.
