<h2>Hello, Rights Recorder user!</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">During the holiday season, some of the legal service providers that Unlock NYC works with are either closed or taking a <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">pause from new intake</strong>. For example, the New York City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) has notified us that they are not accepting referrals for new rapid response interventions between <strong>December 15 and January 2nd.</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">You can still use Rights Recorder during this time if you wish to make a report by clicking the button below. Please note that while the Unlock NYC team will be available during normal business hours (not on holidays or weekends) to review reports and answer questions, we may not be able to make referrals like we usually do until our partners are back in the new year. Thank you in advance for your understanding and patience!</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">We wish you a peaceful and safe holiday season and we are looking forward to continuing to fight with you for a fair housing search in 2026.</h2>
