<h2>Hello, Rights Recorder user!</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">During the holiday season, some of the legal service providers that Unlock NYC works with are either closed or taking a <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">pause from new intake</strong>. For example, the New York City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) has notified us that they are not accepting referrals for new rapid response interventions between <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">December 15 and January 2nd.</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">You can still use Rights Recorder during this time if you wish to make a report by clicking the button below. Please note that while the Unlock NYC team will be available during normal business hours (not on holidays or weekends) to review reports and answer questions, we may not be able to make referrals like we usually do.</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">We'll return to normal operations on <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Monday, Jan 5th</strong> – wishing you a safe and peaceful holiday season in the meantime.</h2>
