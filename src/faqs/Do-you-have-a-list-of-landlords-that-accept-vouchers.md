question: Do you have a list of landlords that accept vouchers?
answer: >
  No, we’re not brokers! Plus, virtually all landlords should accept vouchers if
  the applicant qualifies for the apartment they have advertised. However, we do
  offer tools, tips, and solidarity to support New Yorkers with vouchers
  throughout the apartment search process and can help renters speak up when
  they're being treated unfairly. Many of our team members and volunteers have
  been through the housing search process with a voucher in NYC, and can speak
  about what worked for them. Everyone’s situation is different, and we speak
  from our own experiences in the spirit of community-building and mutual aid.
