question: Do you have a list of landlords that accept vouchers?
answer: >
  No, we’re not brokers! Plus, all landlords should accept your voucher if you
  qualify for the apartment they have advertised. However, we do offer tools,
  tips, and solidarity to support you throughout the apartment search process
  and can help you speak up when you're being treated unfairly. Many of our team
  members and volunteers have been through the housing search process with a
  voucher in NYC, and can speak about what worked for them. Everyone’s situation
  is different, and we speak from our own experiences in the spirit of
  community-building and mutual aid.
