question: Can you present to our staff about your work?
answer: "We love meeting new people who share our passion for ending housing discrimination and wish we could say yes to every request to conduct a workshop or presentation. However, our small team (only 4 staff!) fields more requests than we can handle. Starting in 2024, we encourage organizations to take advantage of our pre-recorded resources, online community, and public events to engage with Unlock NYC. \n\nWe do offer private trainings and workshops on a sliding scale fee to cover the cost of preparation and facilitation â€“\_[contact us](https://airtable.com/appfOQvWUNipVmUdR/shrUjHME2Vw4JBLHV \"Contact us\") if this is of interest to your organization. \n"
