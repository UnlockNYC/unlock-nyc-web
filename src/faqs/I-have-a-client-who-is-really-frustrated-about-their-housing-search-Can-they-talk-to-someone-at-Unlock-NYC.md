question: >-
  I have a client who is really frustrated about their housing search. Can they
  talk to someone at Unlock NYC?
answer: >
  We do not have any staff members who provide direct services to individuals
  and cannot accommodate requests for 1-on-1 consultations. We suggest that you
  encourage your clients to sign up for Rights Recorder, where they will receive
  email-based fair housing educational content, be invited to any webinars or
  community events we host, and also have the ability to make a report about any
  unfair treatment theyâ€™ve experienced from landlords and brokers on their
  housing search.
