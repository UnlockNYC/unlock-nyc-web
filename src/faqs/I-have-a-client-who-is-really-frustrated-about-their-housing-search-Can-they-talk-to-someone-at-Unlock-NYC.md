question: >-
  I have a client who is really frustrated about their housing search. Can they
  talk to someone at Unlock NYC?

  Yes! Please encourage your client to make a report about something theyâ€™ve
  experienced on their housing search. Every new Unlock NYC user will be
  contacted directly by a compassionate and knowledgable member of our Outreach
  team and be connected to our resources and community events.
