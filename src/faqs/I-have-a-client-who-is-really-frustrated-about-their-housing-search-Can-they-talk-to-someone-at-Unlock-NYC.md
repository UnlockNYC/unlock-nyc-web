question: >-
  I have a client who is really frustrated about their housing search. Can they
  talk to someone at Unlock NYC?
answer: >
  Yes! Please encourage your client to make a report about any unfair treatment
  theyâ€™ve experienced from landlords and brokers on their housing search. Every
  new Unlock NYC user will be contacted directly by a compassionate and
  knowledgable member of our Individual Justice team and be connected to our
  resources and community events.
