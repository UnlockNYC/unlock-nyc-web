question: >-
  I’m looking to interview a voucher holder for a story. Can you put me in
  touch?
answer: >
  Unlock NYC works with hundreds of voucher holders across New York City, and we
  work with community members to identify if they are willing to share their
  story with the press. When you fill out our [Media Request
  Form](https://airtable.com/apphhLpaGOzffAyCW/shrl4dCWVD8qewvpw "Media Request
  Form"), please give us as many details as possible about the number of
  interviewees you’re hoping to speak with, what experiences they’d ideally have
  (e.g., voucher type, current housing situation, borough, reports about a
  particular broker/landlord, etc.), interview format (phone, virtual,
  in-person) and access to the questions you plan to ask with as much
  specificity as possible. This helps us efficiently review the request,
  identify possible sources, and obtain full and informed consent before
  introducing them to you. We also ask that members of the press be willing to
  have an Unlock NYC Communications team member sit in on interview(s) with our
  users if they request someone from our team to accompany them.
