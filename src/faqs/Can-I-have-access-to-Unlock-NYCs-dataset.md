question: Can I have access to Unlock NYC’s dataset?
answer: >
  Try our [Data & Research](weunlock.nyc/data "Unlock NYC Data & Research") page
  first to see if the publicly-available aggregated data that we have published
  answers your research question. On a case-by-case basis, we may have the
  interest and capacity to work with journalists on conducting more detailed
  analysis of our dataset and/or engaging in a data-sharing agreement. You can
  [submit a data request
  here](https://airtable.com/appiQkR2Zrww4DQnz/shrV4VpcZcy5BnmBE "Unlock NYC
  Data Request Form"). Please note that we are a small team and we prioritize
  the privacy, security, and integrity of our community’s data, so requests that
  involve data-sharing agreements are normally not suitable for projects with
  tight turnarounds.
