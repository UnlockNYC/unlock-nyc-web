question: What does Unlock NYC do with my report?
answer: "Unlock NYC will add anonymized details about the incident you share with us to our crowdsourced database of where voucher holders are experiencing unfair treatment, who’s doing it, and what tactics they’re using. We work with advocacy partners like the VALUE in Housing Campaign to shine a light on how voucher discrimination is impacting New Yorkers and what needs to change (for an example, check out our recent report\_[here](https://weunlock.nyc/soi-report/))\n\nIf you want individual help with your specific situation, you can also request that we send a copy of your report to organizations who provide counseling on your rights and may be able to connect you to legal services if needed. We can currently connect you with the NYC Commission on Human Rights, the Fair Housing Justice Center, or Fordham Right to Housing Clinic.\n\nYou also don’t have to use Unlock NYC to report! If you prefer, you can report directly to agencies and organizations such as the\_[NYC Commission on Human Rights](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/law/source-of-income.page), the\_[HRA/DSS Source of Income Unit](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hra/help/income-discrimination.page), the\_[Fair Housing Justice Center](https://www.fairhousingjustice.org/our-work/housing-discrimination-complaints/), the\_[New York State Division of Human Rights](https://dhr.ny.gov/complaint#file), the\_[New York State Attorney General's Office](https://ag.ny.gov/source-income-discrimination), or the\_[Fordham Right to Housing Clinic](https://www.fordham.edu/info/30835/right_to_housing_litigation).\n"
