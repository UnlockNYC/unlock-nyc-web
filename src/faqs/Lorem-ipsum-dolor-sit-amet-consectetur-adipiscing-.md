question: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing? '
answer: "Unlock NYC works with hundreds of voucher holders across New York City,\nand we work\_with community members to identify if they are willing to\nshare their story with the press.\_When you fill out our Media Request\nForm, please give us as many details as possible about the number of\ninterviewees you’re hoping to speak with, what experiences they’d\nideally have (e.g., voucher type, current housing situation, borough,\nreports about a particular broker/landlord, etc.), interview format\n(phone, virtual, in-person) and access to the questions you plan to ask\nwith as much specificity as possible. This helps us efficiently review\nthe request, identify possible sources, and obtain full and informed\nconsent before introducing them to you. We also ask that members of the\npress be willing to have an Unlock NYC Communications team member sit in\non interview(s) with our users if they request someone from our team to\naccompany them.\n"
