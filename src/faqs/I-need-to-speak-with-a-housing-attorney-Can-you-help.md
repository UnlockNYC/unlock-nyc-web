question: I need to speak with a housing attorney. Can you help?
answer: "Our team does not have any lawyers on staff and we cannot provide legal advice or representation. However, if you ask us to, we can connect you with an organization who can talk to you about your rights and options under the law and may be able to connect you with legal services. The Met Council on Housing also has a guide to finding a lawyer for housing-related issues\_[here](https://www.metcouncilonhousing.org/help-answers/finding-a-lawyer/), which you may find helpful.\n"
