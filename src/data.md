  Every time someone uses Unlock NYC’s Rights Recorder app to make a report of
  source of income discrimination, our entire community benefits from more intel
  about who’s discriminating, where, and how. By raising our voices together, we
  are building a vivid and detailed picture of what needs to change to make
  housing fair for all New Yorkers.

gridText: >-
  We partner with researchers, community members, and grassroots organizations
  to interpret our growing dataset and use it to spark movement-wide change. We
  publish reports, make policy recommendations, and produce other creative
  research to share our findings.

    text: "Think of us like a citizen science lab –\_for fair housing. We crowdsource our data directly from tenants, then rigorously review, aggregate, and integrate with other housing datasets. At every step, we follow best practices to protect the privacy of user-generated data and embody the guiding principles of 'consentful' tech."

    text: >-
      Landlords and real estate agents continuously adapt the tactics they use
      to mask discriminatory behavior. We stay one step ahead by tracking over
      30 specific tactics (and counting!) and alerting enforcement agencies as
      we identify new trends.

  - title: Changing the narrative
    text: >-
      Voucher holders hold a diverse array of identities, backgrounds, and
      experiences. Through our disparate impact research, we are learning more
      about the ways that discrimination against vouchers impacts specific
      groups differently.
