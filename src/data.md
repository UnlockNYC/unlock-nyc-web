  Every time someone uses Unlock NYC’s Rights Recorder app to make a report of
  source of income discrimination, our entire community benefits from more intel
  about who’s discriminating, where, and how. By raising our voices together, we
  are building a vivid and detailed picture of what needs to change to make
  housing fair for all New Yorkers.

      Think of us as citizen science for fair housing. We crowdsource our data
      directly from tenants, then rigorously review, aggregate, and integrate
      with other housing datasets.

    text: >-
      Our research shows that landlords and real estate agents continuously
      adapt the tactics they use to mask discriminatory behavior. We stay one
      step ahead by tracking over 30 specific tactics (and counting!) and
      alerting enforcement agencies as we identify new trends.
