bannerText: "At Unlock NYC, we create tools that make it easier for New Yorkers with housing vouchers (like CityFHEPS, Section 8, HASA, and more) to keep a paper trail of your housing search, get justice after youâ€™re treated unfairly, and make the voucher system work better for everyone."

howDesignText: We always make sure that New Yorkers who have been directly impacted by voucher discrimination are involved at every step of our design process. Half of our staff and 100% of our governing board have used vouchers in NYC, and we frequently invite others in our community to speak up about what new tools we should build and how to improve our existing tools.
