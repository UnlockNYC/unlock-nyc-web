      We don’t see tech as “the” solution to housing discrimination. Instead,
      our accessible web app creates an outsized impact by working within the
      fair housing ecosystem – activating tenants, saving time for attorneys,
      and equipping advocates with data and insights.

      When vouchers work, they can be a game-changing tool for our city’s most
      vulnerable tenants. Domestic violence survivors can find safety. Patients
      facing health challenges can find a place to recover. Youth aging out of
      foster care can find a home of their own.

  organization so that we can sustain and support our team's creativity,

  emergency fund and technology access lending library enable a more diverse
  group of interns, volunteers, and contractors to work with us, regardless of
  their economic situation. We seek funding partners who value the work and
  financial investment needed to create a diverse and inclusive workplace.
