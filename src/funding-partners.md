      Unlock NYCâ€™s team is multidisciplinary, intergenerational, and 100%
      women-led. By design, half of our staff and 100% of our governing board
      have directly experienced eviction, homelessness, and/or housing
      discrimination. We achieve this through our Leadership Development
      initiative, where we identify participants in our programs with leadership
      potential and offer opportunities to get more involved in our work.
      Leaders gain experience and skills in nonprofit strategy and governance
      while contributing to our mission and building community with each other.
