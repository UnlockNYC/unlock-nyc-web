      Our team is multidisciplinary, intergenerational, 100% women-led, and
      majority-led by tenants who have experienced housing discrimination
      firsthand. By inviting our most engaged program participants to get
      involved behind the scenes at Unlock NYC, potential leaders gain
      experience and skills in nonprofit strategy and governance while
      contributing to our mission and building community with each other.
