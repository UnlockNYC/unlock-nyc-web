  How Source of Income Discrimination and Voucher Policies Perpetuate Housing
  Inequality
reportSummary: >-
  Today, thousands of New Yorkers are locked out of the housing market due to
  “source of income (SOI) discrimination”– one of the most pervasive forms of
  illegal housing bias in New York City. Targeting prospective tenants with
  rental assistance vouchers and supplemental incomes, SOI discriminatory
  practices promote a form of modern-day redlining. In response, Neighbors
  Together and Unlock NYC partnered to expose the scale of the problem, the
  nuances of how SOI discrimination is practiced and how it has changed over
  time, and its devastating impact on New Yorkers fighting to secure stable
  housing. In addition to analyzing 500 untapped SOI discrimination reports with
  the help of the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project and the Housing Data Coalition,
  we have synthesized the history of rental assistance vouchers, examined the
  current policy and enforcement landscape, and conducted interviews with
  voucher holders to ground our findings in the emotional and material impacts
  of SOI discrimination.
