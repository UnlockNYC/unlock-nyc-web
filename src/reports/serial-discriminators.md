  Does your landlord repeatedly turn away voucher holders? Find out for yourself
  – and take action!
reportSummary: "Voucher holders are often in a race against the clock to find an apartment before their voucher expires and penalized if they fail to secure housing in the allotted timespan. This predicament is deeply unfair given the hostility of the housing market towards voucher holders. In this report, we name a total of 23 “serial discriminators,” which we define as entities that have been reported over ten times for suspected SOI discrimination between 2018 and 2023. We then profile the top discriminators in each category, corporate landlords and brokerage firms. This research builds on our February 2022 report, “An Illusion of Choice: How SOI discrimination and voucher policies perpetuate housing inequality,” and our 2023 interactive map of SOI complaints.\_"
