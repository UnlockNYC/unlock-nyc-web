  How the NYC Human Resources Administration falls short of supporting New
  Yorkers with housing vouchers
reportSummary: >-
  Tenants with rental assistance vouchers in New York City regularly experience
  source of income (SOI) discrimination when searching for housing; this
  discrimination exists on a spectrum when considering the intersecting
  identities of voucher holders. Whether a New Yorker is just beginning the
  voucher application process, applying for housing with a landlord, or
  navigating the city’s rental assistance bureaucracy, voucher holders report
  varying experiences of discrimination based on race, gender, disability,
  language, and education. In 2025, Unlock NYC recruited a Participatory Action
  Research (PAR) Committee made up of impacted New Yorkers to connect with
  nearly 200 voucher holders through surveys and interviews to explore how
  racial, gender, and other disparities impact the journeys of voucher holders
  in New York City.   As we parsed through hundreds of stories and data points,
  we decided to zero in on the NYC Human Resources Administration as a poignant
  case study illustrating how voucher holders run up against a rigged system
  designed to fail them. As the nation’s largest social services agency, HRA
  currently serves three million low-income New Yorkers through its public
  benefits programs, including rental and cash assistance programs.
  Unfortunately, our research shows that HRA currently falls short of supporting
  voucher holders in their housing journey, and in fact replicates systemic
  disparities – and we have ideas on how to fix that.
